# Automated_Exam_Proctoring_System
This is the code for my Final Year Project, where I created an Automated Exam Proctoring System. This system is made to maintain exam integrity for online exams taken from home during COVID-19, by utilizing students laptop camera. This system have 5 individual systems, where each of them detect different parts of cheating.

## Identity Verification System
In a physical examination hall with in-person proctors, the first thing they do before you enter the exam is to verify your identity with your student ID card. For my system, it comes with a Login system, where you first have to enter your student ID and password. If the username and password match and are in the database, the name of the student will be fetched from the database. The students laptop camera will then take a picture of the student and run it through the facial recognition system. If the database name and the facial recognition name matches, the student can enter the exam.
